# Professional Assessment System Demo

## Overview
Senali now includes a comprehensive diagnostic assessment system that builds professional profiles for each child mentioned in conversations. This system uses real diagnostic criteria from medical professionals.

## How It Works

### 1. Background Processing
When parents chat with Senali, the system automatically:
- Extracts child names from conversations
- Identifies symptoms and behaviors mentioned
- Updates standardized assessment forms in the background
- Builds diagnostic profiles over time

### 2. Professional Assessment Forms

#### ADHD Assessment (Based on Vanderbilt + DSM-5)
- **Inattention Symptoms** (9 criteria): attention, focus, listening, following instructions, organization, homework avoidance, losing things, distractibility, forgetfulness
- **Hyperactivity/Impulsivity** (9 criteria): fidgeting, staying seated, excessive running/climbing, difficulty with quiet activities, "on the go", excessive talking, blurting answers, waiting turn, interrupting
- **Performance Areas**: Academic performance, peer relationships, following directions, classroom disruption, assignment completion

#### Autism Assessment (Based on DSM-5 + ADOS/ADI-R)
- **Social Communication Deficits** (3 required): social-emotional reciprocity, nonverbal communication, developing/maintaining relationships
- **Restricted/Repetitive Behaviors** (2 of 4 required): stereotyped motor movements, insistence on sameness, restricted interests, sensory reactivity
- **Development History**: Early concerns, language development, social milestones

#### ODD Assessment (Based on DSM-5)
- **Angry/Irritable Mood**: loses temper, easily annoyed, angry/resentful
- **Argumentative/Defiant**: argues with authority, defies rules, deliberately annoys, blames others
- **Vindictiveness**: spiteful or vindictive behavior
- **Context**: Duration, settings affected, severity level

### 3. Smart Symptom Extraction

The system recognizes natural language patterns:

**Example Conversations:**
- "Alex has trouble paying attention in class" ‚Üí Updates ADHD inattention score
- "Sarah doesn't make eye contact and prefers playing alone" ‚Üí Updates autism social communication
- "Emma argues with teachers and loses her temper often" ‚Üí Updates ODD argumentative behavior

**Severity Mapping:**
- "never" ‚Üí 0 points
- "sometimes/occasionally" ‚Üí 1 point  
- "often/frequently" ‚Üí 2 points
- "very often/always" ‚Üí 3 points

### 4. Assessment Insights Generation

When parents ask about patterns or request insights, Senali can provide:

#### ADHD Insights
- Inattention score: X/9 symptoms
- Hyperactivity score: X/9 symptoms
- Likelihood: High/Moderate/Low (based on 6+ symptoms threshold)
- Recommendations for professional evaluation

#### Autism Insights
- Social communication concerns: X/3 areas
- Restricted behavior concerns: X/4 areas
- Likelihood based on DSM-5 criteria (all 3 social + 2 of 4 restricted)
- Developmental considerations

#### ODD Insights
- Total symptom score: X/8 behaviors
- Likelihood based on 4+ symptom threshold
- Duration and setting information
