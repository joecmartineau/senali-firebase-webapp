# Authentication & Profile Fix

## Issue Identified
User signs in successfully with Firebase auth, but app still forces them through family profile setup even when they have existing family data.

## Root Cause
The app's routing logic checks for family profiles **before** user authentication is complete, causing returning users to be sent to family setup unnecessarily.

## Solution Applied
1. **Fixed Profile Check Timing**: Profile detection now runs **after** user authentication
2. **Added Debug Logging**: Console logs show exactly what's happening with profile detection
3. **Streamlined Flow**: Users with existing profiles go straight to chat after sign-in

## Technical Changes
- `checkForExistingProfiles()` now runs only when `user` is set
- Added console logging for profile detection debugging
- Profile check runs on `user` state change instead of component mount

## Result
Returning users with existing family profiles should now:
1. Sign in with Google/Firebase ✅
2. Skip family setup (if profiles exist) ✅  
3. Go directly to chat interface ✅

The Firebase migration is complete and authentication should work smoothly for both new and returning users.
