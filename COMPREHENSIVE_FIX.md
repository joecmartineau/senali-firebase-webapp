# Comprehensive Fix for Profile Persistence Issue

## Current Problems
1. **React Hook Errors**: Invalid hook call errors preventing app from working
2. **Profile Persistence**: Users must re-enter family info each sign-in session
3. **localStorage Not Working**: Data not persisting between browser sessions

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue is likely caused by one of these factors:

### 1. Browser Privacy Settings
- **Incognito/Private Mode**: Automatically clears localStorage on tab close
- **Third-party cookies disabled**: May affect localStorage in some browsers
- **Browser security settings**: Blocking localStorage for security reasons

### 2. App Code Issues
- **Sign-out clearing data**: Previously fixed, but may have other clearing logic
- **Domain/origin issues**: localStorage tied to exact domain/port
- **Timing issues**: Profile check running before data is saved

### 3. Development Environment
- **Hot module reloading**: Vite HMR may be interfering with localStorage
- **Multiple React instances**: Causing hook errors and state issues

## Recommended Solutions

### Immediate Fix (Manual Testing)
1. **Open browser developer console**
2. **Test localStorage manually**:
   ```javascript
   // Save test data
   localStorage.setItem('senali_family_profiles', '[{"name":"Test","age":30,"relationship":"self"}]');
   
   // Check if it persists after page refresh
   localStorage.getItem('senali_family_profiles');
   ```
3. **Check browser settings**: Ensure not in incognito mode
4. **Try different browser**: Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari

### Technical Fix (Code Changes)
1. **Add fallback storage**: Use both localStorage and sessionStorage
2. **Add data validation**: Verify data integrity on save/load
3. **Add user feedback**: Show clear messages about data persistence
4. **Fix React errors**: Resolve hook call issues preventing proper operation

### Browser Compatibility
- **Desktop Chrome/Firefox**: Should work normally
- **Mobile Chrome**: May have stricter localStorage policies
- **Safari**: Has unique localStorage behavior in some cases
- **Incognito mode**: Always clears localStorage on close

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. User fills out family profiles once
2. Data saves to browser localStorage
3. User can sign out and sign back in
4. App detects existing profiles and skips setup
5. User goes directly to chat interface

The issue is likely related to browser settings or the development environment rather than the app code itself.
