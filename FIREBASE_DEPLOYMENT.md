# Firebase Deployment Instructions

## Authentication Required

The build is complete but Firebase deployment requires authentication. Here's how to deploy:

### Step 1: Authenticate with Firebase
```bash
firebase login
```
This will open a browser window for Google authentication.

### Step 2: Deploy to Firebase Hosting
```bash
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

### Step 3: Access Your Live App
After successful deployment, your app will be available at:
- **https://senali-235fb.web.app**
- **https://senali-235fb.firebaseapp.com**

## Current Build Status ✅

- ✅ React app built successfully
- ✅ All assets optimized (495KB main bundle)
- ✅ Firebase configuration ready
- ✅ PWA manifest and service worker configured
- ✅ All features working (chat, auth, credits, AdMob)

## Alternative: Manual Firebase Console Upload

If command line doesn't work, you can manually upload the `dist/public` folder contents to Firebase Hosting through the Firebase Console:

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select project "senali-235fb"
3. Go to Hosting section
4. Click "Get started" or "Add another site"
5. Upload the contents of `dist/public/` folder

## Android Studio Next

The Android build is also ready:
```bash
npx cap open android
```

Then build APK through Android Studio for Google Play Store submission.
