# Profile Persistence Issue - FIXED

## Root Cause Identified ✅
The sign-out function was **deleting family profiles** from localStorage every time users signed out.

**Problematic Code (Line 190 in App.tsx):**
```javascript
// This was clearing family profiles on every sign-out!
window.localStorage.removeItem('senali_family_profiles');
```

## Solution Applied ✅
1. **Removed profile deletion from sign-out** - Family profiles now persist across sessions
2. **Added detailed logging** - Console shows exactly what's happening with profile detection
3. **Preserved other cleanup** - Still clear messages and demo data, but keep family info

## Expected Behavior Now
1. User fills out family profiles once ✅
2. Profiles save to browser localStorage ✅  
3. User can sign out and sign back in ✅
4. Profiles persist and user skips setup ✅
5. Goes directly to chat interface ✅

## Technical Details
- localStorage key: `senali_family_profiles`
- Data format: JSON array of family member objects
- Persistence: Survives browser sessions and sign-out/sign-in cycles
- Detection: Runs after Firebase authentication completes

The issue has been fixed. Users will now only need to fill out family information **once** and it will persist between sessions.
