# How to Download Your Senali Project from Replit

## Method 1: Kebab Menu (Three Dots)
1. **Look for the three dots (⋯) or hamburger menu (☰) in your Replit workspace**
   - Usually located in the top-right corner or top-left of the workspace
   - May be near your project name or in the toolbar
2. **Click the menu and look for:**
   - "Download as ZIP"
   - "Export"
   - "Download project"

## Method 2: File Manager Right-Click
1. **In the file explorer (left sidebar), right-click on your project root folder**
2. **Look for "Download" or "Export" option**
3. **This will download the entire project as a ZIP file**

## Method 3: Individual File Downloads
If you can't find a bulk download option:

1. **Right-click on each folder individually:**
   - Right-click `client/` → Download
   - Right-click `server/` → Download  
   - Right-click `shared/` → Download
   - Right-click `android/` → Download
   - Right-click `functions/` → Download

2. **Download individual config files:**
   - Right-click `package.json` → Download
   - Right-click `vite.config.ts` → Download
   - Right-click `tailwind.config.ts` → Download
   - And so on for each file in the list

## Method 4: Git Clone (If Available)
If your project has Git enabled:
1. **Look for a "Git" or "Version Control" option**
2. **Find the repository URL**
3. **Clone it locally using:** `git clone [your-repo-url]`

## Method 5: Copy-Paste Method (Last Resort)
If no download options work:
1. **Open each important file**
2. **Copy the content (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)**
3. **Paste into new files on your local computer**
4. **Recreate the folder structure manually**

## Where to Look for Download Options

### In the Main Interface:
- **Top menu bar** (near File, Edit, View menus)
- **Project settings** (gear icon or settings button)
- **Account/workspace menu** (your profile picture area)
- **File menu** (if there's a traditional File menu)

### In the File Explorer:
- **Right-click on root folder**
- **Right-click on individual folders**
- **Toolbar above the file list**

## Troubleshooting

### If You Don't See Download Options:
1. **Check if you're the project owner** (some features are owner-only)
2. **Look for different menu locations** (interface may vary)
3. **Try refreshing the page** and looking again
4. **Check if there's a "Share" button** that might have export options

### If Download is Disabled:
- Some Replit plans may have restrictions
- Try the individual file download method instead
- Use the copy-paste method for critical files

## What You're Looking For:
A ZIP file containing all your source code (about 50-100 MB) with these key folders:
- `client/` (React frontend)
- `server/` (Express backend)  
- `shared/` (shared code)
- `android/` (mobile app)
- `functions/` (Firebase functions)
- Configuration files (`package.json`, `vite.config.ts`, etc.)

## Quick Alternative:
If you can't find download options, I can help you identify the most critical files to copy manually. The essential files are listed in the `FILES_TO_DOWNLOAD.txt` file I created.
