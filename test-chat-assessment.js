When parents ask "Do you think Alex might have ADHD?", Senali can now respond:

"Based on our conversations, I've observed several patterns in Alex's behavior that align with ADHD criteria:

üìã Inattention indicators:
‚Ä¢ Difficulty focusing (mentioned frequently)
‚Ä¢ Loses homework/items (daily occurrence)

üìã Hyperactivity indicators:  
‚Ä¢ Excessive fidgeting and talking
‚Ä¢ Difficulty sitting still
‚Ä¢ Interrupts and can't wait turn
‚Ä¢ Blurts out answers

These observations suggest it would be valuable to discuss ADHD evaluation with Alex's pediatrician. I can help you prepare specific examples and questions for that conversation.

Would you like me to help you document these patterns for your doctor's appointment?"

This approach:
‚úÖ Uses professional diagnostic criteria
‚úÖ Provides specific behavioral examples
‚úÖ Encourages medical consultation
‚úÖ Offers practical next steps
‚úÖ Never makes diagnoses
